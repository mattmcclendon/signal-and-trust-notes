# Signal Drift: When Systems Stop Telling the Truth

## The Problem
Most systems do not fail loudly. They continue to operate while slowly losing the ability to describe reality.

This failure mode is subtle. Interfaces still render. Dashboards still refresh. Metrics still improve. Yet the system’s outputs become less aligned with the lived experience of the people subject to them.

This is signal drift.

## How Drift Begins
Signal drift begins when a proxy outlives its context.

A measure is introduced to stand in for something human: safety, fairness, productivity, trust. Over time, that proxy becomes optimized, automated, and abstracted. The original human judgment recedes. The system continues to function, but the signal no longer points to the thing it claims to represent.

At this stage, the system is not broken. It is convincing.

## The Illusion of Objectivity
Drift persists because signals carry the aesthetic of objectivity.

Numbers feel neutral. Charts feel authoritative. Interfaces feel clean. This visual and quantitative coherence masks the fact that the signal has decoupled from reality. Users experiencing friction are treated as anomalies rather than evidence.

When lived experience contradicts the signal, the system trusts the signal.

## Silent Failure Modes
The most dangerous failures share common traits:
- Feedback loops weaken or disappear
- Appeals processes exist but rarely change outcomes
- Optimization rewards internal success over external legitimacy
- Users adapt their behavior to survive rather than to participate

At this point, trust does not collapse. It thins.

## Human Adaptation
People are remarkably good at adapting to untrustworthy systems.

They learn which inputs matter and which are performative. They stop offering honest feedback. They disengage emotionally while remaining compliant. From the outside, the system appears stable.

From the inside, it has already lost consent.

## Why This Matters
Trust is not a sentiment. It is a structural property.

Systems that cannot detect their own drift cannot self-correct. They become brittle, defensive, and increasingly reliant on enforcement rather than legitimacy. Eventually, the gap between signal and reality becomes too large to ignore.

When correction finally arrives, it feels sudden. It is not.

## Closing Observation
Signal drift is not caused by bad actors. It is caused by unexamined success.

Any system that values efficiency without preserving relational feedback will eventually stop telling the truth about itself.

The question is not whether drift will occur.  
The question is whether the system is designed to notice.
